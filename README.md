# ironman-alarmclock

Alarm Clock from the first Iron Man in bash (running on a Raspberry Pi).

## Weather
You have to register for the openweathermap API at api.openweathermap.org and insert your API-key into the script.

## Text-to-Speech
I'm using [responsivevoice.com](responsivevoice.com) to generate the sound file. My messages are created in german, so you may need to adjust them to your language.

## Playing it
I'm using [SoCo](https://github.com/SoCo/SoCo) to play the mp3-file on my Sonos Play:1
